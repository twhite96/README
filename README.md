# Hi, I'm swyx

## Why read me?

I'm writing this in the hope that we can fast forward through some getting-to-know-you facets of me that we might miss (of course doing so IRL is better, but not always possible).

I am really keen to do great work with/for you and I can be extremely, extraordinarily creative and productive under the right conditions.

I am also very imperfect and I hope that my transparency about them here is not treated as an excuse for my flaws but as a guide for you to know how I might fail. Consider this an open invite for you to call me out and prevent bigger pain down the road.

## My former role

I was a DX Engineer at Netlify from 2018-2020. <details><summary>My job description is below.</summary>

- The DX team is focused on empowering developers (customers & partners) by making it as easy &
streamlined as possible for them to build awesome stuff on top of the expanding Netlify Platform.
- The DX team are the internal dogfooders. They stretch, bend, and break the tools Netlify offer to
make things better for the ever expanding group of developers.
- DX work closely with product, support, docs, users & partners to push the product to new heights,
teach users what is possible with the JAMstack, and build tooling/docs/demos to attract people into
the Netlify ecosystem.
- As a DX engineer you will be immersed in a wild range of projects:
  - Building demo applications with bleeding edge tech
  - Coming up with innovative & creative ways to build things on Netlify
  - Working with other SAAS companies and onboarding them as partner integrations
  - Building a world class developer experiences including tooling, CLI
  - Creating content/talks/presentations spreading awareness on whatâ€™s truly possible on Netlify
  - Helping close enterprise sales

In other words: this is a growth + engineering role that traverses from top of funnel (awareness and
education in talks, podcasts, blogs, seminars and workshops) through on-boarding developers into
the product, helping to reduce churn, and improve engagement as well as revenue expansion.

I will be starting a new job later in 2020, but meanwhile, I am writing [a Career Advice book](https://gumroad.com/products/bAZJq/).
  
## Me in a few words

- Born and raised in Singapore, family are all still there and I visit at least once a year. My baby sister is the most important person in the world to me and she is learning to be a dentist!
- Came to the US for college in 2007
- Started my career trading equities, interest rate, currency, and volatility derivatives in investment banks/hedge funds
- Made apps for risk management, pricing, and portfolio management in Python and Haskell as part of the job
- After a brief run in product management decided to make engineering my fulltime job as it's what I enjoy most
- Went through [Fullstack](http://fullstackacademy.com/) to get up to speed on JS as JS is everywhere
- Started being active in [Dev Twitter](https://twitter.com/swyx), speaking in the [NYC tech meetup scene](https://nyc.js.org/), and moderating [/r/reactjs](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs).
- My full english + chinese name is Shawn Wang Yue Xian, when I was 13 people started calling me "swyx" and it stuck.

## What I believe most

1. **[Learn in Public](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1009174159690264579)**: I prefer to share what I learn and work on, after doing my level best, but before it is perfect. This means I will be wrong more often than most people, but I respond very well to people who correct me because I always reserve the right to be wrong. I do not share everything, in particular my political views.
2. **Systems over Goals**: There are things I can control and things I can't. Of the things I can control I focus on the items I can work on more frequently that can compound, and get me tangibly closer toward a goal. But the goal isn't the point. The goal doesn't matter. It is the system that sustainably gets me there that is everything, and I welcome the opportunity to periodically take a step back and work on the system instead of working in the system. 
3. **Intrinsic Drive over Extrinsic Motivation**: [Drive](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/968688836468453376) is a wake-up call to me. I don't quite know what it means yet in the context of work but I definitely function like this. For Netlify it probably maps closest to the team value of Empowerment. I will come up with (too many) ideas and welcome criticism of them, and in return don't take my criticism of your ideas as a criticism of you.

## Accountability

The general thrust of this is: lets agree upon what we need done and why (I'll always have a suggestion), enable me with resources and knowledge, and check in frequently while I throw myself at it.

1. **Start with Why**: I generally (but don't literally) believe in [asking 5 Whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys) and will often question why we are doing a thing as it may not be the best way of achieving our ultimate intended goal.
2. **Frequent, Specific Deliverables**: I work best when I know exactly what is expected of me. I'm also a sprinter and will move heaven and earth to deliver something I've signed up to deliver.
3. **Stretch**: I have no problem signing up for things slightly out of my comfort zone and knowledge level, in fact I love the challenge and do my best work on the edge.

## How I Work

- **How should people set time with you?** I may close Slack when in the flow of things, so I may not always be present there. I check email about twice a day. I generally like scheduling video chats with a day's notice. You can also book time on my calendar whenever i'm not free and then send me a note.
- **What's the best way to discuss issues with you?** I am extremely open to direct 1 on 1 feedback and don't need a [compliment sandwich](https://www.quickbase.com/blog/stop-using-the-compliment-sandwich-and-give-better-feedback).
- **How do you define "Done"?**
- **When are you available?** I am a night owl regardless of time zone, weird but true. I am currently in New York City and typing this at 4am in the morning. I can of course do morning work if it calls for it, but I'm just sharing my weird default.

- *This is a non-exhaustive list; there are definitely more things I can't think of right now.*

# Misc

This idea comes from [Manager README's](https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe) - I'm no manager but I like the idea of READMEs to accelerate getting-to-know-you phases, especially asynchronously. So I'm trying this out.

This is a living document and I hope to update it as I refine my self-knowledge over time. kick me if you think it needs an update.
