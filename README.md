# Hi, I'm Tiffany

## Why read me?

I got this idea from [swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx). This is like a living document that showcases who I am, my strength, weaknesses, and what others have said my strengths and weaknesses are.

I want to build cool stuff, and I hope to be able to do that with your team. As someone leveling up, I *do* have some lingering junior engineer habits that I am trying to shake.

No one is perfect, and I hope that sharing what my failure points are and where I am strong team-wise and problem solving-wise will help us both make an informed decision.

## My former role

I was a Frontend Developer at ICF from 2019-2020. <details><summary>My job description is below.</summary>

- The frontend team was responsible for maintaining and rebuilding legacy UIs for the United States government.
- The frontend team was small but productive under tight deadlines and constraints.
- Frontend devs at ICF work closely with team leads and are expected to follow deployment procedures and ask questions before pushing to production.
- As a Frontend developer you will be immersed in a wild range of similar projects, with varying levels of government clients:
  - Maintaining UIs on most US government web properties
  - Working with designers to rebuild and modernize government systems
  - Speaking with multiple clients from all branches of US government and stating clearly and explicitly what is being done and when it will be completed
  - Moving Jira tickets within a reasonable amount of time
  - Working on virtual machines and using continuous integration/testing with Jenkins
  - Working with AWS

In other words: this is a fast-moving, highly controlled, and tightly budgeted consulting job. The developers are good people and the frontend team is close. As a first job, it may not be ideal, depending on your experience and comfort level with moving fast.

I am currently looking for my next role. If you're interested in talking, <a href="mailto:tiffany@tiffanyrwhite.com">come say hi!</a>
  
## Me in a few words

- Born in Pittsburgh and raised in Harrisburg, PA, I grew up in small lower-middle class neighborhood.
- I attended Catholic school for the first 8 years of my primary education
- I then went to Harrisburg High, a poor district in the middle of PA. Talk about a culture shock!
- Went to college at 23 and bounced from major to major, including electronics engineering, physics, english lit, and then computer science before deciding I hated sitting in classrooms learning things that did not pertain to what I wanted to do as a career.
- I moved to Pittsburgh in 2012 to go to Pitt and get acquainted with my roots.
- I became on official college dropout after many years trying to figure out what I wanted to do.
- Started learning at [freeCodeCamp](https://freeCodeCamp.org/) to get up to speed on JS as JS is everywhere
- I went to several local meetups and created a Twitter account, diving head first into the world that is [Dev Twitter](https://twitter.com/tiffanywhitedev).
- I used to hate being called Tiff when I was younger but now I really don't care.
- I just recently started lifitng weights again and am really enjoying it!

## What I believe most

1. **[Learn in Public](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1009174159690264579)**: I [started a blog](https://tiffanywhite.dev) on Jan 1st, 2015 after picking up learning how to code. It was being preached at the time to share what you're learning so employers can see what you're doing and how you're progressing and doing so landed me a few interviews early on and even two interviews at *big* tech companies.
2. **Asking the right questions**: There may not be any dumb questions, but there certainly *are* wrong ones. When we set out to build something, one of the first questions we should ask is, *does this solve a problem* and if it does, *how does this problem effect our users*. Is there a specific part of the problem we could attack first and if so is it the *right* problem to tackle *at this time*? I like to break things down into smaller pieces and attack from there. 


## Accountability

I can take your feedback. I am curious by nature and will ask a ton of questions in order to make sure I have the crux of the issue down, and will generally work it out from there.

1. **Frequent, Specific Deliverables**: Small chunks of big projects are the best way to utilize my skillset at the moment. Projects with ambiguous directions or projects that make assumptions about what I already know will hinder not just me, but the team as well.
2. **Stretch**: I get excited about new challenges and things slightly outside my skill level. I will occasionally ask for something that I know will challenge me but within my skillset.

## How I Work

- **How should people set time with you?** I never have Slack, Discord, etc open. I'm really sorry but I find them distracting when I am working. When I am working on a team, I keep these apps open but only have @mentions, DMs, or keywords notify me. If you'd like to chat and set time with me, DM me on Twitter or Slack so we can put some time on my calendar.
- **What's the best way to discuss issues with you?** Give it to me straight, no chaser. No one likes that. But also, don't be mean about it.
- **How do you define "Done"?** This is hard because I pay attention to every little detail. I work painstakingly on little flourishes or features I promised I'd get delivered and this can be a really bad flaw of mine. Having an MVP is valuable and [learning to ship](https://seths.blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/theshipitjournal.pdf) is something I am working on.
- **When are you available?** I am a night owl unfortunately but looking to change this. I am currently om the East Coast typing this at 9:45 pm and I am not even remotely tired. I can of course do morning work if it calls for it.

## Personality quirks
- I am reserved and quiet. I tend to observe a situation before speaking up. I need to know that the conversation will move forward and will not be bogged down by small talk. 
- I need to focus on the work when work needs done, without being interrupted by water cooler chat. It's great to talk to your colleagues and managers but it's distracting when there is a deadline or feature I need to get shipped. I'm not saying I *don't* like to have relationships with my peers, but until I really get a sense *of* those peers it is hard for me to engage.


## [Known Failure Modes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1df5MALZKZU6lOeIXUiO-h6ReFM3KuIpnapSE97IZnX4/edit#slide=id.p)

- *This is a non-exhaustive list; there are definitely more things I can't think of right now.*
- Like the above, I have a hard time communicating. I get way too deep into my own head, my own thought, the docs, or whatever and I shut completely down in order to solve a problem. I've been far too independent like this since I was just a toddler and it is a hard habit to break.
- I focus too much on one ticket and don't move things forward, according to my managers at the last job I had. Right as I was getting the hang of this we had layoffs and I was one of those laid off. It is extremely hard for me to let things go unfinished or broken. I am working on this.

# Misc

This idea comes from [Manager README's](https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe) - I'm no manager but I like the idea of READMEs to accelerate getting-to-know-you phases, especially asynchronously. So I'm trying this out.

This is a living document and I hope to update it as I refine my self-knowledge over time. kick me if you think it needs an update.

Thanks again to [swyx](https://swyx.io/) for this idea!
